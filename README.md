# MedriskExpo

This project started as demonstration on "What a developer does?" for a company Expo (to show other departments what we
do).  The idea was to create some animated demos of how Web Applications work (to show some of the "moving parts" of a
web app).  Another demo was added to show some concepts for problem solving and programming (using pseudo-code).

To implement the above animations, I created the Flow Simulator JavaScript files.  I intend to make this a separate
project at some point in the future.

If you find it of value, feel free to use it (warning - I probably used some copyrighted images for the PB&J demo)
